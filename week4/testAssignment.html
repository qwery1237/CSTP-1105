            <li><em>Student Test Results</em>
                <br>
                The test results of six different students are presented below. Each student has gotten a number score ranging between 0 and 100 from 5 of their most recent tests.
                <br>
                Student 1: 70.5, 88.0, 91.0, 85.5, 66.5
                <br>
                Student 2: 90.5, 92.5, 90.0, 95.0, 87.5
                <br>
                Student 3: 75.5, 75.0, 77.0, 75.5, 81.5
                <br>
                Student 4: 55.5, 68.0, 71.5, 85.0, 66.0
                <br>
                Student 5: 70.5, 88.0, 91.0, 85.5, 66.5
                <br>
                Student 6: 80.5, 87.0, 57.0, 75.5, 64.0
                <br>
                <br>
                Arrange the data in a suitable format. Write code that prints a console.log for each student that states "Student X has an average score of Y" where X is the student number and Y is the average or mean of the students' test results fixed to 2 decimal points. After this, print a single console.log that says "Student X has gotten a score of less than 60% => Z" where Z is the score that is below 60. Only do this if the student has gotten a test result below 60.
